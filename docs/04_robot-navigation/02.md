# Navigation Stack Issue Fix Documentation

## Introduction

Before proceeding with the navigation setup, it's crucial to address certain issues that may arise with the ROS navigation stack. This documentation provides step-by-step instructions to resolve these issues, ensuring smooth navigation stack operation.

## Issue Overview

There are known issues related to the navigation stack on ROS, particularly concerning the loading of maps. Failure to address these issues can impede progress in subsequent lessons. However, solutions are available to mitigate these problems.

## Precautionary Steps

Before proceeding with the fix, ensure to follow these preparatory steps:

- Watch the accompanying video tutorial for a comprehensive understanding.
- Perform the steps exactly as demonstrated to avoid errors.
- Exercise caution and ensure precise execution of commands.

## Fixing Navigation Stack Issues

### 1. Installation of Cyclone DDS

- Change the DDS (Data Distribution Service) from Fast DDS to Cyclone DDS, enhancing navigation stack compatibility.
  1. Update the package repositories: `sudo apt update`.
  2. Install Cyclone DDS: `sudo apt install ros-<distribution>-cyclonedds-cpp`.
     - Replace `<distribution>` with your ROS distribution (e.g., `melodic`, `noetic`).
  3. Set environment variable:
     - Edit `.bashrc` file: `nano ~/.bashrc`.
     - Add the following line:
       ```
       export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
       ```
  4. Save the file and exit the editor (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y`).
  5. Close and reopen the terminal or execute: `source ~/.bashrc`.

### 2. Modifying Parameter File

- Adjust parameters in the TurtleBot 3 navigation package to ensure compatibility with the modified DDS.
  1. Navigate to the package directory: `cd /opt/ros/<distribution>/share/turtlebot3_navigation2`.
     - Replace `<distribution>` with your ROS distribution.
  2. Open the parameter file: `sudo nano param/waffle.yaml`.
  3. Locate the `robot_model_type` parameter and modify it as follows:
     - Change `differential` to `differential_cL: differential_motion_model`.
  4. Save the file (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y`).
  5. Reboot your system to ensure the changes take effect: `sudo reboot`.

## Conclusion

By following these instructions meticulously, you can effectively resolve navigation stack issues encountered during the loading of maps. These fixes enable seamless integration of SLAM-generated maps into the navigation stack, facilitating efficient robot navigation within the environment.

For further assistance or clarifications, refer to the provided resources or seek support from the course instructor.

Ensure to proceed with the navigation setup only after successfully implementing these fixes to avoid potential hindrances.

Happy navigating!
