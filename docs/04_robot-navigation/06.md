# Activity: Making a Robot Navigate Using a Map

## Introduction

In this activity, you will practice making a robot navigate using a pre-generated map of a house. The goal is to navigate the robot through different rooms of the house autonomously. Follow the steps outlined below to complete the activity.

## Steps to Complete the Activity

1. **Launch Gazebo and Load the Map**:

   - Open a terminal and launch Gazebo with the TurtleBot 3 house world: `roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch`.
2. **Start Navigation Stack**:

   - Open a new terminal and start the navigation stack:
     ```
     roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=/path/to/your/map.yaml
     ```

     - Replace `/path/to/your/map.yaml` with the path to the map YAML file you generated previously.
3. **Provide 2D Pose Estimate**:

   - Use RViz to provide the initial 2D pose estimate of the robot within the map.
   - Estimate the robot's position and orientation by clicking on the estimated location in the map view.
4. **Set Navigation Goals**:

   - Use RViz to set navigation goals for the robot.
   - Start with small goals and gradually navigate through different rooms of the house.
5. **Patrol Through Rooms**:

   - Experiment with giving navigation goals one by one to navigate the robot through different rooms of the house.
   - Optionally, utilize the waypoint follower functionality to define a sequence of waypoints for the robot to patrol through multiple rooms.
6. **Test and Iterate**:

   - Test the navigation behavior and observe how the robot navigates through the environment.
   - Iterate on setting navigation goals and refining the robot's path to ensure smooth and efficient navigation.

## Recommendations and Tips

- **Start Small**: Begin by navigating the robot through individual rooms before attempting longer navigation paths.
- **Waypoint Follower**: Utilize the waypoint follower functionality to define complex navigation paths through multiple rooms.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Pay attention to dynamic obstacles that may appear during navigation and observe how the robot adapts its path to avoid collisions.

## Conclusion

By completing this activity, you will gain practical experience in navigating a robot using a pre-generated map. Experiment with different navigation goals and strategies to effectively navigate the robot through various rooms of the house. Use the provided tools and functionalities to refine the robot's navigation behavior and achieve successful navigation outcomes.

Once you've completed the activity, you'll be better equipped to apply navigation techniques in real-world scenarios and enhance the autonomy of your robot in navigating complex environments.

Happy navigating!
