## Why Navigation in ROS 2?

Navigation is a critical aspect of robotics, enabling robots to move autonomously and navigate complex environments. In ROS 2, the Navigation Stack plays a pivotal role in achieving autonomous navigation. Here's why navigation is essential in ROS 2:

- **Rapid Development Platform:** ROS 2 provides a robust development platform for robotics applications, allowing developers to focus on higher-level functionalities without reinventing the wheel.
- **Autonomous Navigation:** The Navigation Stack bridges the gap between utilizing ROS 2 and enabling autonomous navigation. It offers a collection of packages designed specifically for achieving autonomous movement in ROS 2 environments.

## Goals of Autonomous Navigation

The primary objective of autonomous navigation is to enable robots to navigate safely from one point to another while avoiding obstacles and adhering to predefined constraints. This process involves two main steps:

1. **Mapping with SLAM:** Create a map of the robot's environment using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques. This map provides spatial awareness for navigation.
2. **Path Planning and Execution:** Plan and execute paths from one location to another using the generated map. The Navigation Stack ensures safe navigation by avoiding obstacles and following predefined paths.

By understanding the fundamentals of autonomous navigation and leveraging the capabilities of ROS2-Nav2, you can empower your robots to navigate complex environments autonomously and efficiently.
