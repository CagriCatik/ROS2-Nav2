# Navigation System Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for implementing a navigation system tailored for robotic applications. The navigation process encompasses two primary stages: map generation and navigation. The fundamental objective is to facilitate the movement of a robot from one location to another while navigating around obstacles effectively.

## Map Generation

Map generation marks the initial phase in the navigation process, involving the creation of an environment map where the robot will operate. This map acts as a crucial reference for the robot to navigate autonomously.

### SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

SLAM, an acronym for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, is a pivotal technique utilized for map generation. It enables a robot to localize itself within an environment while concurrently creating a map of its surroundings. SLAM plays a vital role in ensuring precise navigation by providing the robot with spatial awareness relative to obstacles and landmarks.

#### Utilizing SLAM with ROS (Robot Operating System)

1. **Setup**: Verify the correct installation of essential components.
2. **Initialization**: Initiate SLAM functionality within the robot's operating environment.
3. **Execution**: Activate both the robot and SLAM functionality simultaneously.
4. **Map Generation**: Allow the robot to traverse the environment while SLAM generates a map.
5. **Saving the Map**: Once the map is generated, save it for subsequent navigation tasks.

## Hands-On Implementation

### Preparing the Environment

Before initiating map generation, ensure that the following prerequisites are fulfilled:

- ROS (Robot Operating System) is correctly installed.
- The Gazebo simulator is configured to simulate the robot's environment.
- Essential dependencies and configurations are in place.

### Executing Map Generation

1. **Launching the Environment**: Start the simulation environment in Gazebo with the configured robot model.
2. **Activating SLAM**: Initiate SLAM functionality to facilitate map generation.
3. **Robot Movement**: Allow the robot to traverse the environment while SLAM captures relevant data.
4. **Monitoring Progress**: Monitor the real-time map generation process using visualization tools.
5. **Saving the Map**: Once the map accurately represents the environment, save it for future navigation tasks.

## SLAM Steps

Below are the commands to be executed during the SLAM section of the ROS2 Nav2 Course. These commands are specific to the Turtlebot3 robot used as an example. General commands for other robots will be provided in Section 7 of the course.

When encountering text in red, replace it with the appropriate value.

1. **Start your robot stack**

   ```
   $ ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
   ```
2. **Start SLAM**

   ```
   $ ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=True
   ```
3. **Move the robot to generate the map**

   ```
   $ ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
   ```
4. **Save the map**

   ```
   $ ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/my_map
   ```
