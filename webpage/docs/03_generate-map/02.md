# Robot Setup and Movement in Simulated Environment

## Introduction

This documentation segment provides instructions for setting up a robot in a simulated environment using TurtleBot3. The tutorial focuses on initializing the robot's movement capabilities, essential for subsequent tasks like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for map generation.

## Pre-Setup Considerations

Before diving into the robot setup process, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- ROS (Robot Operating System) is installed and configured correctly.
- Gazebo simulator is installed and operational.
- Necessary dependencies for TurtleBot3 are installed.

## Robot Initialization and Movement

### Setting TurtleBot3 Model

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the bashrc file using your preferred text editor (e.g., nano, vim).
2. Locate the following line in the bashrc file:

   ```
   export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
   ```
3. Modify the model to your desired TurtleBot3 model (e.g., waffle):

   ```
   export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
   ```
4. Save the changes and close the text editor.

### Launching Gazebo Simulator

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Execute the following command to start Gazebo simulator:

   ```
   gazebo
   ```
3. Verify that Gazebo launches without errors and observe the simulation environment.

   - Check that the application's status bar displays a stable FPS (Frames Per Second) count (e.g., around 60 FPS).
   - Ensure that the real-time factor is close to 1, indicating real-time simulation performance.
4. Close Gazebo by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal window to gracefully exit.

### Starting TurtleBot3 in Simulated Environment

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Execute the following command to launch TurtleBot3 in the Gazebo simulation environment:

   ```
   ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
   ```
3. Wait for Gazebo to load the simulation environment and spawn the TurtleBot3 robot.

   - Initial loading may take some time, especially on the first launch. Be patient and allow Gazebo to complete the process.
4. Once TurtleBot3 is successfully spawned in the simulated world, proceed to control its movement.

### Controlling Robot Movement

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Execute the following command to control TurtleBot3's movement using a keyboard:

   ```
   ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
   ```
3. Use the following keyboard keys to maneuver the robot:

   - **w**: Move forward
   - **s**: Stop
   - **a**: Rotate left
   - **d**: Rotate right

   Note: Experiment with different key combinations to navigate the robot smoothly within the simulated environment.
4. Practice controlling the robot's movement to familiarize yourself with the keyboard commands and ensure smooth navigation.

## Conclusion

Upon completing the steps outlined in this documentation, you should have successfully set up TurtleBot3 in a simulated environment and mastered basic robot movement control using a keyboard interface. This groundwork is essential for subsequent tasks such as SLAM-based map generation, which will be covered in subsequent tutorials.
