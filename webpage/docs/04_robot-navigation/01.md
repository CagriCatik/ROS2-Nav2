# SLAM Navigation Documentation

## Introduction

Congratulations on your progress in this course! You have successfully generated a map of an environment using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques. This documentation will guide you through the process of utilizing this map for navigation purposes.

## Navigation Process Overview

The navigation process involves two main steps:

1. **Map Generation**: Initially, you move your robot within the environment to create a map. This step involves exploration and data collection to understand the layout of the surroundings.
2. **Robot Navigation**: After generating the map, the robot navigates from one point to another within the environment using the map data.

## Map Generation

During the map generation phase, your robot explores the environment and collects data to create a representation of the surroundings. This representation typically consists of two components:

- **Image File**: Contains pixel data representing free and occupied space within the environment.
- **YAML File**: Provides additional information about the map, such as metadata and configuration details.

## Navigation Setup

Once the map is generated, you proceed to the navigation phase. Follow these steps to set up navigation:

1. **Robot Initialization**:

   - For real robots: Start the robot within the environment.
   - For simulation: Launch the simulation environment using Gazebo.
2. **Navigation Stack Initialization**:

   - Start the navigation stack, which includes algorithms and modules responsible for robot navigation.
3. **Providing the Map**:

   - Provide the generated map to the navigation system. This map will serve as the reference for the robot's navigation.
4. **User Interface (UI)**:

   - Utilize the provided interface, such as RViz, to interact with the navigation system.
   - Use the interface to input navigation commands and monitor the robot's movement.

## Navigation Execution

Once the navigation setup is complete, the robot is ready to navigate within the environment. The navigation system utilizes the provided map data to guide the robot from one point to another. Key features of the navigation system include:

- **Path Planning**: Automatically computes the optimal path from the robot's current location to the target destination.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Ensures that the robot navigates around obstacles present in the environment, including both existing and newly encountered obstacles.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Adapts to changes in the environment, such as the addition of new obstacles during navigation.

# Navigation Steps

These commands are the ones you will run in this section on Navigation. Use this PDF to easily access them while doing the exercises. Some of the commands are specific to the Turtlebot3 robot, which we use as an example. Later on in the course (Section 7), you will also get the general commands to run for any robots.

## Steps

When you see some text in red, replace it with the correct value.

1. **Start your robot stack**

   ```
   $ ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
   ```
2. **Start Navigation 2**

   ```
   $ ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py use_sim_time:=True map:=path/to/world_map.yaml
   ```
3. **Set 2D Pose Estimate**
   Click on RViz
4. **Send a Navigation2 Goal**


## Conclusion

With the completion of this documentation, you are now equipped to utilize the SLAM-generated map for robot navigation. By following the outlined steps, you can efficiently navigate your robot within the environment while ensuring safe and obstacle-free movement.
