# Waypoint Follower Functionality in Navigation Documentation

## Introduction

In this section, you will learn about a valuable functionality in robot navigation known as the Waypoint Follower. This feature allows you to specify multiple waypoints for the robot to navigate through sequentially. This documentation provides a guide on how to utilize the Waypoint Follower effectively in ROS navigation.

## Understanding Waypoint Following

The Waypoint Follower enables the robot to navigate through a predefined sequence of points autonomously. Instead of providing individual navigation goals, you can specify a series of waypoints for the robot to traverse.

## Using the Waypoint Follower

Follow these steps to utilize the Waypoint Follower functionality:

1. **Access Waypoint Navigation Mode**:

   - In the navigation interface (e.g., RViz), select the Waypoint navigation mode.
2. **Add Waypoints**:

   - Click on the map to add waypoints sequentially.
   - Specify the desired orientation for each waypoint if necessary.
3. **Start Waypoint Following**:

   - Once all waypoints are added, initiate the Waypoint Follower.
   - Click on the "Start waypoint following" button.
4. **Observing Robot Movement**:

   - Observe how the robot navigates through each waypoint in sequence.
   - Monitor the robot's progress and behavior in the navigation interface.
5. **Completing the Waypoint Path**:

   - Upon reaching the final waypoint, the robot completes the navigation path.

## Additional Options

Explore the following options for waypoint navigation:

- **Start Now Through Poses**:

  - This option attempts to create a continuous path through all waypoints without stopping.
  - Note: This feature may not be as stable as traditional waypoint following and may encounter issues.
- **Cancel Accumulation**:

  - If waypoints are added incorrectly or need to be reset, use the "Cancel Accumulation" option to clear the accumulated waypoints.

## Best Practices and Considerations

Consider the following best practices when using the Waypoint Follower:

- **Stability**: While traditional waypoint following is more stable, experiment cautiously with the "Start Now Through Poses" option.
- **Waypoint Placement**: Ensure that waypoints are placed accurately to define the desired navigation path effectively.
- **Observation**: Monitor the robot's behavior closely during waypoint following to detect any anomalies or issues.

## Conclusion

The Waypoint Follower functionality provides a flexible and efficient way to navigate robots through predefined paths. By understanding and utilizing this feature effectively, you can achieve precise and reliable navigation in various environments.

Experiment with different waypoint configurations and options to familiarize yourself with the capabilities of the Waypoint Follower. Practice navigating robots through complex paths to enhance your proficiency in robot navigation using ROS.

Happy waypoint following!
