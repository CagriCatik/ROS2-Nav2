# Robot Navigation Using SLAM-Generated Map Documentation

## Introduction

In this section, you will learn how to navigate a robot using a map generated through Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We will continue with the TurtleBot 3 example used previously in this course. This documentation provides step-by-step instructions to execute robot navigation using the SLAM-generated map.

## Navigation Setup

Before proceeding with navigation, ensure that the robot is initialized within the environment. Follow these steps to set up navigation:

1. **Start the Robot in Gazebo**:

   - Launch Gazebo with the TurtleBot 3 world: `roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch`.
   - Verify that the robot, environment, and laser scan data are correctly displayed in Gazebo.
2. **Open a New Terminal**:

   - Open a new terminal window to execute navigation commands.
3. **Start Navigation Stack**:

   - Launch the navigation stack for TurtleBot 3:
     ```
     roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch use_sim_time:=true map:=maps/my_map.yaml
     ```

     - Ensure to replace `maps/my_map.yaml` with the path to your SLAM-generated map YAML file.

## Providing 2D Pose Estimate

Before initiating navigation, it's essential to provide a 2D pose estimate of the robot's current position within the map. Follow these steps to provide the pose estimate:

1. **Launch RViz Interface**:

   - RViz should automatically launch with the navigation stack.
2. **Provide 2D Pose Estimate**:

   - Click on the '2D Pose Estimate' button in RViz.
   - Click and hold on the approximate location of the robot on the map.
   - Adjust the orientation arrow to match the robot's actual orientation.
3. **Confirm Localization**:

   - Ensure that the rectangular marker aligns with the robot's approximate location in the map.
   - Verify that the laser scan data matches the environment in RViz.

## Setting Navigation Goal

After providing the pose estimate, you can set a navigation goal for the robot. Follow these steps to set a navigation goal:

1. **Select Goal Location**:

   - Click on the '2D Nav Goal' button in RViz.
   - Click and hold on the desired location for the robot to navigate to on the map.
   - Adjust the orientation arrow if necessary to specify the desired heading.
2. **Initiate Navigation**:

   - The robot will begin moving towards the specified goal location autonomously.
   - Follow the progress of the robot in RViz using the pink and blue visualization lines.

## Monitoring Navigation

During navigation, you can monitor the robot's progress and behavior in RViz. Keep an eye on the following:

- **Robot Movement**: Observe how the robot navigates through the environment, avoiding obstacles and following the planned path.
- **Goal Achievement**: Monitor the robot's progress towards reaching the navigation goal.
- **Recovery Behavior**: Note any recovery behaviors initiated by the navigation stack if the robot encounters obstacles or navigational challenges.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this documentation, you can effectively utilize the SLAM-generated map to navigate a robot within the environment. Ensure to provide accurate pose estimates and set valid navigation goals for optimal performance. Experiment with different scenarios to familiarize yourself with robot navigation using ROS and SLAM-generated maps.

For further exploration, consider customizing navigation parameters or integrating additional sensors for enhanced navigation capabilities.

Happy navigating!
