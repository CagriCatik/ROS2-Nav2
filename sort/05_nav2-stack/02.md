## Understanding Global and Local Planners in the Navigation Stack

In this lesson, we'll explore the functionalities of the global and local planners within the navigation stack. Rather than diving into theoretical explanations, we'll gain insights through a live demonstration. Let's break down the process step by step:

### 1. **Setting Up the Environment**

- We start by launching the turtlebot3 world and the navigation stack, ensuring a clean environment for experimentation.

### 2. **Global Planner**

- The global planner receives the navigation goal and computes a high-level path (represented in pink) to reach the destination.
- It utilizes a cost map, which assigns costs to different areas of the map based on obstacles and other factors.
- The cost map guides the global planner in finding the most optimal path while avoiding obstacles and minimizing costs.

### 3. **Local Planner**

- The local planner, also known as the controller, receives the global plan and translates it into low-level commands for the robot.
- It continuously updates the robot's trajectory (represented in blue) based on real-time sensor feedback and deviations from the global plan.
- The local planner ensures smooth navigation by adjusting the robot's velocity and steering to follow the planned path while avoiding obstacles.

### 4. **Visualization**

- Visualizing the global and local plans allows us to observe how the robot navigates through the environment.
- The global plan provides a high-level overview of the intended path, while the local plan adapts to the robot's immediate surroundings to ensure safe and efficient navigation.

### 5. **Analogous to GPS Navigation**

- An analogy to GPS navigation helps in understanding the roles of the global and local planners:
  - The global planner acts like a GPS system, determining the overall route from the starting point to the destination.
  - The local planner functions as the driver, interpreting the GPS instructions and making real-time adjustments to navigate through traffic and obstacles.

### 6. **Path Execution**

- The combination of the global and local planners allows the robot to navigate autonomously by generating and following paths in dynamic environments.
- The global planner plans routes based on map information, while the local planner adjusts the robot's trajectory to account for real-time obstacles and conditions.

### 7. **Optimization and Tuning**

- Fine-tuning parameters and configurations of both global and local planners can enhance navigation performance, ensuring smoother trajectories and faster response to changes in the environment.

By understanding the functionalities of the global and local planners and their interactions within the navigation stack, we gain insight into how autonomous robots navigate through complex environments. Through practical experimentation and visualization, we develop a deeper understanding of the navigation process and its underlying mechanisms.

Now, let's continue exploring other components of the navigation stack, building upon this foundation to further enhance our understanding and capabilities in robotic navigation.
