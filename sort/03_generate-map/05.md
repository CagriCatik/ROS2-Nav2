# Activity: Generating a Map with SLAM

## Introduction

Welcome to the first activity of this course! In this activity, we will apply the concepts learned in previous lessons to generate a map using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Your challenge is to follow the steps outlined below to generate a map for the "TurtleBot3 House" world.

## Challenge Description

Your task is to generate a map for the "TurtleBot3 House" world using SLAM. Follow these steps to complete the challenge:

1. **Launch Gazebo with the TurtleBot3 House world**: Use the following command to start Gazebo with the TurtleBot3 House world:

   ```
   roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo.launch world:=house
   ```

   Be patient as it may take some time to load the world.
2. **Start SLAM functionality**: Launch the SLAM functionality for TurtleBot3 using the command:

   ```
   roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch
   ```
3. **Start the teleoperation node**: Initiate the teleoperation node to control the TurtleBot3's movement in the environment. Use the command:

   ```
   roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
   ```
4. **Explore and map the environment**: Use the teleoperation keys to navigate the TurtleBot3 inside the house and explore the environment. Move the robot around to map the interior of the house.
5. **Save the generated map**: Once you are satisfied with the mapping, save the generated map using the command:

   ```
   rosrun map_server map_saver -f my_map
   ```
6. **Verify the saved map**: Check the "maps" directory to ensure that the map files (`my_map.pgm` and `my_map.yaml`) have been saved successfully.

## Notes

- The TurtleBot3 House world features a house with an open exterior area. Focus on mapping the interior of the house.
- Be patient during the loading process, especially when launching Gazebo with the new world.
- Use the teleoperation keys to maneuver the TurtleBot3 robot inside the house and map its surroundings effectively.

## Conclusion

Complete the steps outlined above to generate a map for the "TurtleBot3 House" world using SLAM. Once you have saved the map successfully, you will have completed this activity. If you encounter any challenges or need clarification, feel free to refer back to the course materials or seek assistance. Good luck!
